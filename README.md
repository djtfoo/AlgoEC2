# Question
Using closed address hashing, compare between different hashing functions.

# Our Application
Our dataset is a list of Singapore postal codes and their corresponding street/building names. These data are stored in a closed address hash table.
The <b>average CPU time</b> and <b>average number of key comparisons</b> are observed across different hash functions.

# Built With
C++ - Programming language<br>
CodeBlocks - The IDE used
